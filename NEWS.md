# nlmixr2plot 2.0.8

* `plot()` now returns a named list of lists so that users can more easily
  choose which plots to include, if all plots are not desired.  Or the user
  could use those names as the basis of figure captions (fix #8).

# nlmixr2plot 2.0.7

* Added fixes for upcoming 'ggplot2' 3.4 release

* Added changes for the generalized log-likelihood supported by 'nlmixr2est'

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
